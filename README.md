This is my first Next.js App. I got attracted to Next.js by it's "File-system Routing" function. Every component in the `pages` directory becomes a route!

According to https://pagepro.co/, the Benefits of using Next.js for development are below:

Next JS comes with many features that translate into benefits – not only for business and marketing but also for the development process. The most important thing that developers love is reusable components. As for business, it cuts development costs. As for developers, it cuts development time.

However, there are more features that are helpful for developers. They especially enjoy:

Built-in CSS support – possibility to import CSS files from a JavaScript file.
Built-in Image Component and Automatic Image Optimization – this feature automatically optimises images using the new next/image component
Fast Refresh – fast, live-editing experience. 
Hybrid of SSR and SSG – prerender pages at build time or request time in a single project.
Incremental Static Generation – it allows developers to update existing pages by re-rendering them in the background as traffic comes in. This way, static content can become dynamic.
TypeScript support – automatic TypeScript configuration and compilation.
Zero Config – Next allows you to focus on the business logic of your Next js app instead of the application logic. And to help you, it provides automatic compilation and bundling. In other words, Next is optimised for production right from the start.

I will be following Kapehe's freeCodeCamp.org tutorial to build this. Link: https://youtu.be/1WmNXEVia8I

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
